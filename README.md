# Real-Time Facial and Hand Gesture Recognition System

## Project Overview
This project is a Python-based application that uses computer vision techniques to perform facial recognition and hand gesture detection in real time. With the help of the OpenCV library, it processes video feed from a webcam to identify registered individuals and interpret hand signals by counting the number of fingers raised.

## Features
- **Facial Recognition**: Identifies and verifies faces against a pre-stored database of images.
- **Background Blurring**: Offers privacy by blurring the background during a video feed.
- **Facial Structure Outlining**: Enhances the visibility of facial features by outlining them.
- **Hand Gesture Recognition**: Counts and displays the number of fingers raised.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- MySQL (for storing and retrieving facial image data)

## How to Use
To use this application, you will need to have Python installed on your system along with the OpenCV and mysql-connector-python libraries. After setting up the database with facial images, simply run the main script to start the facial and hand gesture recognition.
